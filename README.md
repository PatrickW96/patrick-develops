Redesigning and recreating my Portfolio page. This is my new and improved personal portfolio. This portfolio is made with a mobile first approach but still looks good when displayed on tablets, laptops, and of course, desktops. This portfolio uses bootstrap as the main front end frame works but I also used animate.css to add animations. I also use jQuery to  create a dynamic web page by easily manipulating the DOM.
